# DRP Presentation: Knot Sliceness & Low-Dimensional Topology

Semester-long directed study on knot sliceness and 4-manifold topology, centered on Lisa Piccirillo’s 2020 proof that the Conway knot is not slice. Worked through the geometric and algebraic techniques underlying the argument, including constructions in smooth 4-manifold theory, and presented findings in a formal talk.
